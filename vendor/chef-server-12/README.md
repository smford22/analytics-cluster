Prerequisits
-----
This cookbook need an secret key to be able to handle the PEM key
in secure mode. If you are using Test Kitchen the key already exist.

If you want to regenerate the existing key run:
```
$ openssl rand -base64 512 > test/integration/default/encrypted_data_bag_secret
```
If you are using `chef-solo` you have to manually create the secret key and
configure `solo.rb`.

Platform
-----
Chef Server v12 packages are available for the following platforms:

* Redhat 6.5 64-bit
* Centos 6.5 64-bit
* Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10 64-bit

Usage Solo Mode

This cookbook can be used on `solo` mode to spinup a Chef Server v12.

```
- Configure `/etc/chef/solo.rb`
```
cookbook_path "/etc/chef/cookbooks"
encrypted_data_bag_secret "/etc/chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret"
http_proxy ENV['http_proxy']
https_proxy ENV['https_proxy']
```
- Create a `/etc/chef/dna.json`
```
{
  "run_list" : ["chef-server-12::default"],

  /* This will override the default api_fqdn attribute from the cookbook */
  /* Use it only if you have multiple ip addresses or if you want to set */
  /* the hostname/FQDN on it. */

  "chef-server-12" : {
    "api_fqdn":"ANOTHER_IP_ADDRESS"
  }
}
```
